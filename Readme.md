ZenToDo

A simple ToDo-List that let's you focus on what's really important

This project implements an Android-app which serves as a simple ToDo-List. The idea is simple: you drop tasks that come to your mind so you don't have to think about them anymore. In a next step you pick all the tasks you want to get done. These are shown in a focus mode that only represent tasks that are really important right now. Tasks can also have a date set which means they will not be shown until that date. There is also an option to make tasks recurring. Tasks can also be added to lists.

The App contains the following main layouts:

-Drop: add new tasks, so you don't have to worry about them

-Pick: presents all tasks that are due today and lets you pick which ones to get done

-Focus: presents all tasks that you picked including a color mode, that marks all tasks belonging to one list in the same color

-Lists: shows all the lists and according tasks including a list called "All Tasks" which shows ALL tasks in increasing order of due date, in case you want to change anything
