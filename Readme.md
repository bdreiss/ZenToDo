ZenToDo

A simple ToDo-List that let's you focus on what's really important

This project aims to implement an Android-app which serves as a simple ToDo-List. Tasks added have a due date and optionally a list to which they are attached. Now every time you want to create a ToDo-List for the day there is a mode called "focus", which presents the tasks that are due and let's you choose the todos that you want to get done. Hence there are only the really important things in your list which ought to improve your focus.

The App is going to contain the following windows:

-Brainstorm and Pick (still to  be implemented): presents all tasks that are due today and lets you choose which ones to get done

-Todays Focus (still to  be implemented): presents all tasks that you picked including a color mode, that marks all tasks belonging to one list in the same color

-Drop your Thoughts (still to  be implemented): add new tasks, so you don't have to worry about them

-Lists (still to  be implemented): shows all the lists and according tasks including a list called "All Tasks" which shows ALL tasks in increasing order of due date, in case you want to change anything
