ZenToDo

A simple ToDo-List that let's you focus on what's really important.

This project implements a hands-on ToDo-List for Android. The idea is simple: you drop tasks that come to your mind so you don't have to think about them anymore. Then you only PICK tasks you want to get done. The others can be assigned reminder dates or lists. The tasks you picked are shown in FOCUS and represent thins that are really important right now. Tasks with a reminder date will not be shown until that date again. There is also an option to make tasks recurring. Or you just leave them in a list.

The App contains the following main layouts:

-DROP: add new tasks, so you don't have to worry about them

-PICK: presents all tasks that are due today and lets you pick which ones to get done

-FOCUS: presents all tasks that you picked including a color mode, that marks all tasks belonging to one list in the same color

-LISTS: shows all the lists and according tasks including a list called "All Tasks" which shows ALL tasks in increasing order of due date, in case you want to change anything
